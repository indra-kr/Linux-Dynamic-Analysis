-  [SLTracer](https://github.com/indra-kr/Linux-Dynamic-Analysis/blob/master/SLTracer) : A trace program for system call and library call on the 32bit linux machine.
-  [SendHookPoC](https://github.com/indra-kr/Linux-Dynamic-Analysis/blob/master/SendHookPoC) : A PoC code for hooking the send syscall by ptrace on the 32bit and 64bit machines.

These implementations were from private pilot project for the PoC of dynamic analysis about mobile applications.
